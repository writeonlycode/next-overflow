# Next Overflow

Next Overflow is an open-source starter project built with Next.js and Supabase
that provides a solid foundation for building a StackOverflow-like web
application. It's designed to enable developers to quickly set up a
feature-rich platform for users to ask and answer questions on various topics,
search for existing questions, and vote on answers. Next Overflow is ideal for
developers looking to create a similar platform or seeking inspiration for
their project. Potential users include developers who want to learn and
practice building full-stack applications, startups, and businesses looking to
create a Q&A platform for their customers or employees.

## Technologies Used

Next Overflow is built using the following technologies:

- **Next.js:** A popular open-source React framework for building server-side
  rendered (SSR) web applications.

- **SWR:** A React Hooks library that provides a data-fetching solution with
  client-side caching and automatic revalidation. It enables efficient handling
  of requests for data that is frequently updated and provides a smooth user
  experience by returning cached data while fetching updated data in the
  background.

- **Supabase:** An open-source backend as a service (BaaS) platform that
  provides developers with tools to build scalable and secure web and mobile
  applications faster.

- **Tailwind CSS:** A popular utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to
  create responsive and customizable user interfaces.
