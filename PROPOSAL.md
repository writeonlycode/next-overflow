# Project Proposal: Next Overflow

Next Overflow is an open-source starter project built with Next.js and Supabase
that provides a solid foundation for building a StackOverflow-like web
application. It's designed to enable developers to quickly set up a
feature-rich platform for users to ask and answer questions on various topics,
search for existing questions, and vote on answers. Next Overflow is ideal for
developers looking to create a similar platform or seeking inspiration for
their project. Potential users include developers who want to learn and
practice building full-stack applications, startups, and businesses looking to
create a Q&A platform for their customers or employees.


## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Features:

- **Ask Questions:** Users will be able to submit questions through a form that
  saves them to the Supabase database.

- **Answer Questions:** Users will be able to answer questions submitted by
  other users through a form that saves their answers to the Supabase database.

- **Search for Questions:** Users will be able to search for questions using a
  search bar that queries the Supabase database for matching questions and
  displays them to the user.

- **Upvote/Downvote Questions & Answers:** Users will be able to upvote or
  downvote questions & answers to questions, with the total vote count
  displayed next to each questions & answer.


## Future Improvements:

- **Question Categories:** Users will be able to categorize their questions by
  topic, making it easier for other users to find relevant questions and
  answers.

- **Comment on Questions/Answers:** Users will be able to leave comments on
  questions and answers, allowing for more in-depth discussions.

## Timeline (MVP Features Only):

  to the Supabase database.

- [x] **Day 5:** Implementing the core functionality of searching for
  questions, including creating a search bar that queries the Supabase database
  for matching questions and displays them to the user.

- [x] **Day 6:** Implementing the core functionality of upvoting/downvoting
  answers, including adding buttons for users to vote on answers and updating
  the database with the vote count.

- [ ] **Day 7:** Testing, bug fixing, and finalizing the MVP.


## Technologies Used:

- **Next.js:** A popular open-source React framework for building server-side
  rendered (SSR) web applications. It provides several features that make
  building web applications easier, such as automatic code splitting,
  server-side rendering, static site generation, and hot module replacement.

- **SWR:** A React Hooks library that provides a data-fetching solution with
  client-side caching and automatic revalidation. It enables efficient handling
  of requests for data that is frequently updated and provides a smooth user
  experience by returning cached data while fetching updated data in the
  background.

- **Supabase:** An open-source backend as a service (BaaS) platform that
  provides developers with tools to build scalable and secure web and mobile
  applications faster. It includes a PostgreSQL database, real-time
  subscriptions, and API endpoints for authentication, authorization, and
  storage.

- **Tailwind CSS:** A popular utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to
  create responsive and customizable user interfaces. It provides a set of
  pre-defined CSS classes that can be used to style HTML elements, and can also
  be customized with your own styles.


## Conclusion:

Next Overflow provides an easy-to-use starting point for building a
fully-featured StackOverflow-like web application. It provides a solid starting
point for building a platform for knowledge sharing and collaboration, allowing
users to ask and answer questions on a wide range of topics, share insights and
expertise, and engage in meaningful discussions. With its intuitive UI/UX
design and core features such as asking and answering questions, searching for
questions, and upvoting/downvoting questions & answers.
